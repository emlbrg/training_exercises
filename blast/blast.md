Here’s another bioinformatics problem that could be both interesting and less complex than previous suggestions:

### Problem: **Finding Homologous Sequences Using BLAST**
The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is widely used for comparing nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases. The goal is to implement a simplified version of sequence similarity search using a basic string matching algorithm.

**Objective:** Given a query sequence, search for homologous sequences in a small set of target sequences and output the best matches based on a simple scoring system (e.g., matching characters).

### Step 1: Problem Breakdown
- **Input:** A query sequence and a set of target sequences (can be stored in a list or a FASTA file).
- **Output:** The target sequences that best match the query sequence, along with a similarity score.

### Key Challenges
1. **String Matching Algorithm:** Implement a basic string matching algorithm to identify similar sequences (e.g., sliding window, or simple substring search).
2. **Scoring System:** Define a simple scoring system based on matches, mismatches, and gaps.
3. **Result Comparison:** Compare the results with a known BLAST output from the NCBI BLAST tool as the "gold standard."

### Step 2: Multiple Implementations

#### 1. **Naive String Matching Approach**
- Implement a naive approach that checks every substring of the query against the target sequences.

**Pros:**
- Simple and straightforward to implement.
- Good for understanding the basics of string matching.

**Cons:**
- Inefficient for longer sequences or large datasets due to O(n*m) complexity.

#### 2. **Sliding Window Approach**
- Use a sliding window to evaluate potential matches more efficiently.

**Pros:**
- More efficient than the naive approach.
- Allows for better control of match length and scoring.

**Cons:**
- Still limited in scalability for very large datasets.

#### 3. **Using Biopython for BLAST**
- Use Biopython’s `Ncbiblastn` module to perform a local BLAST search on the query against a database of sequences.

**Pros:**
- Takes advantage of optimized BLAST algorithms.
- More accurate and powerful than manual implementations.

**Cons:**
- Requires installation of Biopython and dependencies.
- More complex to set up compared to basic algorithms.

### Step 3: Benchmarking and Comparison
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Use Python’s `timeit` module to measure the execution time of each approach.
- **Result Comparison:** Run a local BLAST search using Biopython or command-line BLAST and compare the output to your implementations.

### Step 4: "Golden Standard" Comparison
To compare your results with the BLAST output:
- Run BLAST using a known sequence database (like the NCBI database) to find homologous sequences.
- Compare your approach’s best matches and scores against the BLAST results.

**Example Implementation Structure:**

```python

    Returns:
        Dict[str, int]: Dictionary of target sequences with their similarity scores.
    """
    pass  # Implement naive string matching logic.

def sliding_window_matching(query: str, targets: List[str]) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """

    Args:

    Returns:
        Dict[str, int]: Dictionary of target sequences with their similarity scores.
    """
    pass  # Implement sliding window logic.

def blast_search(query: str, database: str) -> List[Tuple[str, int]]:
    """
    Use Biopython to perform a BLAST search.

    Args:
        query (str): Query DNA sequence.
        database (str): Path to the target sequence database.

    Returns:
        List[Tuple[str, int]]: List of homologous sequences and their scores.
    """
    pass  # Implement BLAST search using Biopython.
