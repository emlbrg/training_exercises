### Problem: **Counting K-mers in DNA Sequences**

K-mers are all the possible subsequences of length `k` in a DNA sequence. Counting k-mers is a basic task in genomics, used for sequence comparison, assembly, and analysis of repetitive patterns.

**Objective:** Implement different methods to count k-mers (subsequences of length `k`) in a given DNA sequence and compare the results with a "gold standard" tool like **Jellyfish**, which is a fast k-mer counting tool.

### Step 1: Problem Breakdown
- **Input:** A DNA sequence and a specified length `k` for the k-mers.
- **Output:** A dictionary where keys are k-mers and values are their counts in the sequence.

### Key Challenges
1. **Efficient Sliding Window:** Implement efficient traversal of the sequence to extract and count all k-mers.
2. **Memory Considerations:** For longer sequences or larger values of `k`, you need to handle memory efficiently.
3. **Result Comparison:** Compare your k-mer counts with the output from Jellyfish (which you can run as the "gold standard" for k-mer counting).

### Step 2: Multiple Implementations

#### 1. **Naive Sliding Window Approach**
- Use a simple sliding window to extract all k-mers from the sequence and count them.

```python
def naive_kmer_count(sequence: str, k: int) -> Dict[str, int]:
    kmer_counts = {}
    for i in range(len(sequence) - k + 1):
        kmer = sequence[i:i+k]
        if kmer in kmer_counts:
            kmer_counts[kmer] += 1
        else:
            kmer_counts[kmer] = 1
    return kmer_counts
```

**Pros:**
- Very simple to implement.
- Works well for small sequences and small values of `k`.

**Cons:**
- Inefficient for large sequences due to O(n) complexity for each sliding window operation.
- Memory usage can grow rapidly for large `k`.

#### 2. **Hash Map-Based Approach**
- Use a dictionary (hash map) to store k-mer counts as you slide through the sequence.

```python
def hashmap_kmer_count(sequence: str, k: int) -> Dict[str, int]:
    from collections import defaultdict
    kmer_counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(len(sequence) - k + 1):
        kmer = sequence[i:i+k]
        kmer_counts[kmer] += 1
    return kmer_counts
```

**Pros:**
- More efficient lookups and counting compared to the naive approach.
- Scales better with larger sequences.

**Cons:**
- Memory-intensive for very large sequences.

#### 3. **Optimized Approach Using Collections (Counter)**
- Use Pythonâ€™s `collections.Counter` to count k-mers more efficiently.

```python
def optimized_counter_kmer_count(sequence: str, k: int) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """
    Optimized k-mer counting using Python's Counter.
    
    Args:
        sequence (str): The DNA sequence.
        k (int): Length of the k-mers.
    
    Returns:
        Dict[str, int]: Dictionary of k-mer counts.
    """
    from collections import Counter
    kmers = (sequence[i:i+k] for i in range(len(sequence) - k + 1))
    return Counter(kmers)
```

**Pros:**
- Efficient and concise code.
- Faster and less memory-intensive than manually managing a hash map.

**Cons:**
- May not offer as much flexibility if you need to customize the counting process.

### Step 3: Benchmarking and Comparison
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Measure the time each implementation takes to count k-mers in large sequences.
- **Result Comparison:** Run the same input through Jellyfish to count k-mers and compare the results (you can compare counts for each k-mer).

### Step 4: "Golden Standard" Comparison
Run **Jellyfish** as the "gold standard" tool. Jellyfish is designed for efficient k-mer counting and is highly optimized for large datasets. You can compare the counts from your Python implementations with the output from Jellyfish to validate the accuracy and performance.

**Example Implementation Structure:**

```python
def naive_kmer_count(sequence: str, k: int) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """
    Naive sliding window approach to count k-mers.
    
    Args:
        sequence (str): The DNA sequence.
        k (int): Length of the k-mers.
    
    Returns:
        Dict[str, int]: Dictionary of k-mer counts.
    """
    kmer_counts = {}
    for i in range(len(sequence) - k + 1):
        kmer = sequence[i:i+k]
        if kmer in kmer_counts:
            kmer_counts[kmer] += 1
        else:
            kmer_counts[kmer] = 1
    return kmer_counts

def hashmap_kmer_count(sequence: str, k: int) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """
    Hash map-based k-mer counting.
    
    Args:

        k (int): Length of the k-mers.
    
    Returns:
        Dict[str, int]: Dictionary of k-mer counts.
    """
    from collections import defaultdict
    kmer_counts = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(len(sequence) - k + 1):
        kmer = sequence[i:i+k]
        kmer_counts[kmer] += 1
    return kmer_counts

def optimized_counter_kmer_count(sequence: str, k: int) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """

    """
    from collections import Counter
    kmers = (sequence[i:i+k] for i in range(len(sequence) - k + 1))
    return Counter(kmers)
```

This problem is simpler but still allows for multiple implementations with different trade-offs in performance and memory usage. You can compare your results with a high-performance k-mer counter like Jellyfish, which can serve as your "gold standard."
